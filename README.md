## Objective
As part of the Le Wagon bootcamp, we had to create an AirBnB inspired rails app. Space Out is free and would be useful for booking meeting spaces within an organisation.

* Book a meeting space
* Cancel a booking
* Add a new meeting space
* Update meeting space details
* Delete your meeting space

## Tools
Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
